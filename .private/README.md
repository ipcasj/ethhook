# Private Development Files

This directory contains internal development files, scripts, and documentation that are not intended for end users or public distribution.

## Contents

### Root Directory
- Development tracking documents (audit reports, completion markers)
- Internal guides and temporary documentation
- Railway deployment configs (deprecated - now using DigitalOcean)
- Development scripts and testing utilities
- Log files

### /scripts/
Development and testing scripts:
- Test runners (e2e, integration)
- Development environment startup/shutdown
- Railway deployment scripts
- Test verification utilities

## Note
These files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the public repository clean and focused on production-ready code and user-facing documentation.
