## ‚úÖ SUCCESS!

## Troubleshooting

### No webhook after 5 minutes?

**Option 1**: Check logs for delivery
```bash
docker logs ethhook-webhook-delivery --tail 50
```

**Option 2**: Use wildcard contract (catches ALL events)
```
Contract Address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

**Option 3**: Check endpoint is active
```bash
docker exec ethhook-postgres psql -U ethhook -d ethhook -c \
  "SELECT id, webhook_url, is_active FROM endpoints ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

**Option 4**: Manually test webhook.site URL
```bash
curl -X POST https://webhook.site/YOUR-ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "manual test"}'
```
Check webhook.site - you should see this test request.
