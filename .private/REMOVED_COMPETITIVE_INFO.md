**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Purpose**: Backup of business/competitive sections removed from public ARCHITECTURE.md

## 🔴 REMOVED SECTION 1: Competitive Positioning

This section was at the top of ARCHITECTURE.md (lines 7-26)

### Original Content:

```markdown
### Competitive Positioning

| Feature | EthHook | Alchemy Notify | QuickNode | Moralis Streams |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Language** | 🦀 Rust | Node.js | Node.js | Node.js |
| **Open Source** | ✅ Core | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Self-Hosting** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Latency** | <500ms | ~1-2s | ~1-2s | ~2-3s |
| **Custom Filters** | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Basic | ✅ Basic | ✅ Basic |
| **Free Tier** | 10k events/mo | 5k events/mo | None | 1k events/mo |
| **Pricing** | $9/mo starter | $49/mo | $299/mo | $49/mo |
| **Multi-chain** | Roadmap | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Unique Value Propositions

1. **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions = 10x lower latency than Node.js competitors
2. **Transparency**: Open-source core with optional managed hosting
3. **Developer First**: Best-in-class DX with WASM portal, comprehensive docs, SDKs
4. **Cost Effective**: Pass RPC cost savings (from efficient Rust) to customers
5. **Reliability**: Built-in retries, deduplication, and delivery guarantees
```

**Why Removed**: 
- Reveals your pricing strategy ($9/mo)
- Shows competitive analysis (you vs Alchemy/QuickNode/Moralis)
- Claims 10x performance advantage
- Reveals cost savings strategy
- Could alert competitors before you launch

**Keep Private**: This is your competitive positioning. Use it for:
- Internal strategy discussions
- Investor presentations
- Marketing materials (after launch)
- Sales pitches

## 🔴 REMOVED SECTION 2: Deployment Costs

This section was in the "Deployment" section (lines 613-675)

### Original Content:

```markdown
Cost: ~$50-100/month (Basic tier)

### Option B: Droplets + Kubernetes (Scalable)

[... kubernetes diagram ...]

Cost: ~$150-300/month (Production-ready)

### Recommended Specs (Launch)

| Component | DigitalOcean Resource | CPU | RAM | Cost/month |
|-----------|----------------------|-----|-----|------------|
| Admin API | App Platform (Basic) | 1 vCPU | 512MB | $5 |
| Event Ingestor | App Platform (Basic) | 1 vCPU | 512MB | $5 |
| Message Processor | App Platform (Pro) | 2 vCPU | 1GB | $12 |

| Redis | Managed DB (Basic) | 1 vCPU | 1GB | $15 |
| Static Frontend | Cloudflare Pages | - | - | $0 |
| **Total** | | | | **~$64/month** |
```

**Why Removed**:
- Reveals your infrastructure costs ($64/month)
- Shows your cost structure and margins
- Could help competitors understand your pricing strategy
- Reveals exact deployment architecture with costs

**Keep Private**: This is your cost analysis. Use it for:
- Financial planning
- Pricing decisions (what margins you have)
- Understanding your competitive advantage
- Investor discussions
