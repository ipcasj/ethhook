# UI Demo Ready Guide - Complete Working Frontend

**Goal**: Get the frontend portal working perfectly for client demos and proof of concept

---

## Current Situation

✅ **Backend**: All services running, real endpoint configured
❌ **Frontend**: Showing old webhook.site endpoints (cached data)

**We need**: Fresh, working UI showing only active endpoints with real data

---

## Solution: Fresh Start with UI Testing

### Step 1: Restart Frontend (Clean Cache)

```bash
# Kill current trunk process
pkill -9 trunk

# Navigate to frontend
cd /Users/igor/rust_projects/capstone0/crates/leptos-portal

# Clean build cache
rm -rf dist/ .parcel-cache/

# Start fresh
trunk serve --port 3002 --open
```

**Result**: Browser opens automatically to http://localhost:3002 with fresh UI

---

### Step 2: Create NEW Test User for Demo

Open: http://localhost:3002

**Click "Register"** and create a fresh demo account:

```
Name: Igor Demo
Email: igor+demo@ethhook.io
Password: Demo123!@#
```

**Why new user?**
- Clean slate, no old data
- Perfect for client demos
- Shows onboarding flow

---

### Step 3: Create Application via UI

After login, you'll see the Dashboard.

**Click**: "+ Create Application"

**Fill in**:
```
Name: Production Webhook Monitor
Description: Real-time Ethereum event monitoring for production use
```

**Click**: "Create"

**Result**: New application created, you're redirected to app details

---

### Step 4: Add Real Endpoint via UI

In your new application:

**Click**: "+ Add Endpoint" or "Create Endpoint"

**Fill in the form**:

```
Name: Real Sepolia WETH Monitor
Description: Monitoring WETH transfers on Sepolia testnet

Webhook URL:
http://host.docker.internal:8000/webhook

Contract Addresses:
0x7b79995e5f793A07Bc00c21412e50Ecae098E7f9

Event Signatures:
Transfer(address,address,uint256)

Chain IDs:
11155111

Rate Limit: 10 (default)
Max Retries: 5 (default)
Timeout: 30 (default)

Active: ✅ YES (check the box!)
```

**Click**: "Create Endpoint"

**Result**:
- Endpoint created in database
- HMAC secret auto-generated
- Shows in UI immediately
- Ready to receive webhooks!

---

### Step 5: Start Webhook Receiver

Open new terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/igor/rust_projects/capstone0
./test_real_webhooks.sh
```

**You'll see**:
```
🚀 REAL WEBHOOK RECEIVER STARTED!
📍 Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8000
⏳ Waiting for webhooks from EthHook...
```

**Keep this running!**

---

### Step 6: Monitor the UI (Real-Time Demo)

Now open these in your browser:

**Tab 1: Dashboard**
```
http://localhost:3002/dashboard
```
Watch stats update in real-time:
- Total Applications: 1
- Webhook Endpoints: 1
- Events Today: (increasing)
- Success Rate: (should be 100%)

**Tab 2: Endpoints List**
```
http://localhost:3002/endpoints
```
See your endpoint:
- Status: 🟢 Active
- URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/webhook
- Contract: 0x7b79...E7f9
- Event: Transfer(...)

**Tab 3: Events Log**
```
http://localhost:3002/events
```
See captured blockchain events as they arrive

**Tab 4: Grafana**
```
http://localhost:3001
Login: admin / admin
```
Real-time metrics and graphs

## Troubleshooting UI Issues

### Issue: Old endpoints still showing

**Solution 1: Filter by status**
```
In UI, look for "Active" filter toggle
Only show active endpoints
```

**Solution 2: Database cleanup**
```bash
# Delete ALL old endpoints
docker exec ethhook-postgres psql -U ethhook -d ethhook -c "
DELETE FROM endpoints
WHERE webhook_url LIKE '%webhook.site%';
"

# Refresh UI (Cmd+Shift+R)
```

**Solution 3: Fresh user account**
```
Register new demo user
Create fresh application
Add new endpoint
No old data to show!
```

### Issue: Frontend not updating

**Hard refresh**:
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Clear browser cache**:
```
F12 → Network tab → Disable cache
OR
Chrome → Clear browsing data → Cached images
```

**Restart trunk**:
```bash
pkill -9 trunk
cd crates/leptos-portal
trunk serve --port 3002
```

### Issue: Can't create endpoint

**Check API**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
# Should return: OK
```

**Check logs**:
```bash
docker logs ethhook-admin-api --tail 50
```

**Test authentication**:
```
Make sure you're logged in
Check browser console (F12) for errors
```
