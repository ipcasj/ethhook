# E2E Test Implementation Status

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Summary

We've made significant progress implementing a comprehensive E2E test with a mock Ethereum RPC server. The test successfully starts all services and connects the Event Ingestor to the mock, but there's still one remaining issue to resolve.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Mock Ethereum RPC WebSocket Server (`tests/mock_eth_rpc.rs`)

- ‚úÖ Created complete WebSocket server using `tokio-tungstenite`
- ‚úÖ Listens on random port (`127.0.0.1:0`)
- ‚úÖ Handles `eth_subscribe("newHeads")` subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Sends block notifications with correct JSON-RPC format
- ‚úÖ Handles `eth_getBlockByNumber` requests
- ‚úÖ Handles `eth_getTransactionReceipt` requests
- ‚úÖ Returns realistic USDC Transfer event data
- ‚úÖ Keeps WebSocket connection alive in a loop
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown support

### 2. Full E2E Test (`test_full_pipeline_with_mock_ethereum`)

- ‚úÖ Test setup with PostgreSQL and Redis connections
- ‚úÖ Creates test data (user, app, endpoint)
- ‚úÖ Endpoint configured for USDC Transfer events on chain_id=1
- ‚úÖ Mock webhook server (WireMock) to verify delivery
- ‚úÖ Starts all three services using pre-built binaries
- ‚úÖ Correct environment variable configuration
- ‚úÖ Services start successfully and connect to their dependencies

### 3. Configuration Fixes

- ‚úÖ Fixed environment variable names (`ETHEREUM_WS_URL`, not `ETH_MAINNET_WS_URL`)
- ‚úÖ Added `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` for Event Ingestor
- ‚úÖ Added `REDIS_URL` for Message Processor and Webhook Delivery
- ‚úÖ Added `chain_ids` array to endpoint creation (critical!)
- ‚úÖ Fixed binary path resolution (workspace-relative paths)
- ‚úÖ Fixed package/binary name mapping for `cargo run -p`
- ‚úÖ Switched to using pre-built binaries directly
- ‚úÖ Fixed JSON field naming (camelCase: `parentHash` not `parent_hash`)

### 4. Service Integration

- ‚úÖ Event Ingestor connects to mock RPC successfully
- ‚úÖ Event Ingestor subscribes to `newHeads` successfully
- ‚úÖ Event Ingestor receives block notifications
- ‚úÖ Event Ingestor begins processing blocks
- ‚úÖ Message Processor starts and connects to Redis/PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Webhook Delivery starts with 50 workers

## ‚è≥ Remaining Issues

### Issue: Event Ingestor Processing Loop

**Symptom**: Event Ingestor repeatedly processes the same block every ~500ms:

```text
Processing block #18000000 (hash: 0xabc123...)
Processing block #18000000 (hash: 0xabc123...)
Processing block #18000000 (hash: 0xabc123...)
```

**Analysis**:

1. Event Ingestor receives `newHeads` notification ‚úÖ
2. Sends `eth_getBlockByNumber` request ‚úÖ
3. Mock responds with block + transactions ‚úÖ
4. Event Ingestor should then fetch transaction receipts
5. **Problem**: Either the response parsing fails, or the logic loops

**Possible Causes**:

- `eth_getBlockByNumber` response format might be incorrect
- Missing fields in the block response
- Event Ingestor expects different transaction format
- Response deserialization fails silently

**What to Check**:

1. Compare mock response format with real Alchemy/Infura response
2. Check if `transactions` array should contain full transaction objects (not just hashes)
3. Verify all required fields are present in camelCase
4. Add error logging to see why it's looping

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Created

- `tests/mock_eth_rpc.rs` (202 lines) - Mock Ethereum RPC WebSocket server
- `docs/MOCK_ETHEREUM_TESTING.md` - Testing architecture documentation
- `docs/E2E_TEST_STATUS.md` (this file)

### Modified

- `tests/e2e_tests.rs`:
  - Added `mod mock_eth_rpc;`
  - Created `test_full_pipeline_with_mock_ethereum()` (140+ lines)
  - Fixed `create_test_endpoint()` to include `chain_ids`
  - Updated `start_service()` to use pre-built binaries
  - Added Redis stream inspection
  - Fixed environment variables
  
- `tests/Cargo.toml`:
  - Added `tokio-tungstenite = "0.21"`
  - Added `futures-util = "0.3"`
  - Added `anyhow = "1.0"`
  - Added `tracing = { workspace = true }`

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (< 30 minutes)

1. **Fix the processing loop issue**:
   - Check real Ethereum RPC response format for `eth_getBlockByNumber`
   - Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted
   - Verify transaction format (array of hashes vs full objects)
   - Add error logging to identify parsing failures

2. **Verify complete pipeline**:
   - Once loop is fixed, events should publish to `raw-events` stream
   - Message Processor should consume and match endpoints
   - Webhook Delivery should call the mock HTTP server
   - WireMock should verify webhook was received

### Short Term (1-2 hours)

1. **Add more test scenarios**:
   - Multiple blocks in sequence
   - Events that don't match any endpoints
   - Multiple events in one block
   - Service recovery/restart

1. **Consumer group validation**:
   - E2E test for XREADGROUP usage
   - Verify XACK acknowledgments
   - Check XPENDING queues empty
   - Test service kill/restart

### Long Term

1. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Add E2E tests to CI pipeline
   - Ensure Docker Compose setup for Redis/PostgreSQL

1. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with testing instructions
   - Document mock RPC usage
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## üéâ Achievements

Despite the remaining loop issue, we've made excellent progress:

1. **Created sophisticated mock server** that simulates Ethereum WebSocket endpoint
2. **Fixed numerous configuration issues** (env vars, binary paths, field names)
3. **Successfully integrated all three services** in a test environment
4. **Demonstrated end-to-end connectivity** (Event Ingestor connects and subscribes)
5. **Established testing infrastructure** for future improvements

The remaining work is primarily debugging the block processing logic and ensuring correct response formats - we're very close to a fully working E2E test!

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Environment variables matter**: Different services expected different var names
2. **Serde naming conventions**: `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` requires exact JSON field names
3. **Binary execution**: Using pre-built binaries is faster than `cargo run`
4. **WebSocket persistence**: Connection handler must loop to handle multiple requests
5. **Silent failures**: Serde parse errors caught by `if let Ok()` can hide issues
6. **Trace logging essential**: Debug/trace logs critical for WebSocket debugging
7. **Schema alignment**: Mock responses must exactly match expected schemas
