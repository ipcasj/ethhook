## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Identify Issue**
   - Check Railway logs
   - Identify failing service
   - Determine root cause

2. **Quick Fixes** (try first)
   - Fix environment variable
   - Restart service
   - Rerun migrations

3. **Rollback** (if quick fix doesn't work)
   - Railway ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Deployments
   - Find last successful deployment
   - Click "Rollback"
   - Verify services running

4. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Update deployment checklist
   - Prevent future occurrences

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ All 4 backend services running
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL accessible
- ‚úÖ Redis accessible
- ‚úÖ Frontend deployed and accessible
- ‚úÖ User can register and login
- ‚úÖ User can create application
- ‚úÖ User can create endpoint
- ‚úÖ Events are being ingested from blockchain
- ‚úÖ Webhooks are being delivered to endpoints
- ‚úÖ Health checks passing
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Response times < 500ms (p95)
- ‚úÖ Webhook success rate > 95%

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Fix Before Deployment)

- ‚ùå Database migrations fail
- ‚ùå Services won't start
- ‚ùå Critical security vulnerability
- ‚ùå Data loss potential

### Medium Risk (Fix if Time Permits)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance not optimal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests failing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor bugs in UI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical warnings in logs

### Low Risk (Can Fix After Deployment)

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Documentation gaps
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Code quality improvements
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Nice-to-have features
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è UI polish
